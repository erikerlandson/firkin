# firkin

storage, aging, and access for small structured data

### usage

Fire up a Firkin server with 

    com.freevariable.firkin.Firkin.start()(colossus.IOSystem())

or `sbt server/console`.

You'll then have a server running on port 4091.  You can store and access data via the following HTTP routes:

* `POST /cache` with a payload of JSON data:  this will store the object you provided and redirect you to its location in the cache
* `GET /cache`:  this will return a list of all the hashes currently in the cache
* `GET /cache/$HASH`:  this will return the object in the cache with hash `$HASH` or 404

Submitting empty POST data or submitting invalid JSON as POST data will result in various 4xx errors.

To interact with Firkin using `curl`, try the following:

    % curl -i -d '{"foo":"bar"}' http://localhost:4091/cache
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: http://localhost:4091/cache/a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a
    Content-Length: 0
    
    % curl http://localhost:4091/cache/a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a
    {"foo":"bar"}
    
    % curl http://localhost:4091/cache/
    {"cachedKeys":["a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a"]}

To interact with Firkin using its Scala client library, try the following:

    scala> val client = new com.freevariable.firkin.Client("localhost", 4091)
    client: com.freevariable.firkin.Client = com.freevariable.firkin.Client@3f342608

    scala> client.put("""{"foo": "bar"}""")
    res0: String = http://localhost:4091/cache/a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a
    
    scala> client.getOrElse("a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a", "sorry!")
    res1: String = {"foo":"bar"}

### answers to frequently anticipated questions

1.  A firkin is 4.091 L but we can't have fractional ports.
2.  In order:  it's useful to have a sink for relatively small structured data that you generate with one thing and want to consume with another.  Also: NIH.
